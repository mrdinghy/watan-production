Due to the successful implementation and the dire needs, that same year, WATAN worked to support bakeries and supplied 210 tonnes of flour, in Deir ez Zor with Rahma International. &nbsp;The program expanded by shifting the focus to more sustainable long-term outcomes, from planting seed schemes, farming tools and agricultural services to livestock support.</p><p><strong>WATAN Program Philosophy and Differentiators:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Emergency rapid response is at the core of the Food security and livelihood programs planning. &nbsp;With partners on the ground inside Syria, readily available to access various hard-to-reach areas with security in mind, in order to reach the most vulnerable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>WATAN aims to develop its program accomplishments to activities that involve increasing skill levels and enabling communities to have varied skills in order to provide sustainability. WATAN is also looking to expand its role in providing assistance to small businesses and business partnerships as well as offering micro grants, internships and scholarships. WATAN also wants to expand its capacity in agriculture and livestock, by enlarging its scope and beneficiary numbers.</p><p>WATAN’s work in the FSL program stands out for various reasons:</p><p>·People: Its dedicated staff, volunteers and partner network are working to provide access to nutritious food in hard-to-reach areas and promote lasting solutions under difficult security conditions.</p><p>·Presence: Present in all provinces and have accessibility to all areas affected by the Syrian crisis. &nbsp;WATAN has an incomparable network, deep field presence, local knowledge and great relations, both inside Syria and out.</p><p>·Long lasting sustainable interventions: Responding with impactful interventions, such as micro grants and livestock exchange schemes, with the aim of having sustainable long-term results, which will continue to be a primary focus for the community. Seeing the success of others in the community will build awareness. Micro gardening is an example of this, where achievement is impactful and motivating for others to follow.</p><h1><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">WATAN projects:</span></h1><ul><li>Rapid Emergency Assistance</li><li>RAF Distributions</li><li>Working for a Better Life</li><li>Qurbani 2016</li></ul><h1><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Overall numbers and graphs:</span></h1><p>2012- 35,000 beneficiaries</p><p>2013- 215,551 beneficiaries</p><p>2014- 524,000 beneficiaries</p><p>2015- 100,000 beneficiaries</p><p>2016- 77,309 beneficiaries</p><p>Total accumulative beneficiaries: 951,860 beneficiaries</p><p><strong>Location of interventions:</strong></p><p><strong>Syria:</strong></p><p>Rural Idleb, Rural Ghouta Rural Hama, Rural Homs and Hasaka</p><p>Lebanon:</p><p>Tarablous</p><p><strong>Turkey:</strong></p><p>Orfa</p>", body2: nil, body3: nil, locations: nil},

The convention had guests and key note speakers and honor guests.

The convention was covered by several media channels, including the BBC. This convention since then has been running annually.</p><p>The Civil Society Support program aims to build the capacities of civil society organisations and local councils through a set of certified international programs, which are designed to meet training and development needs to enable these institutions to provide the best humanitarian services at the highest level of standards and professionalism by maximum utilisation of the limited human and financial resources. In 2013, the first workshop for capacity building aimed at leaders of the civil society organisations took place and in 2016, the program expanded to become a comprehensive program to address many areas including advocacy and proposal writing.</p><p><strong>WATAN Program Philosophy and Differentiators</strong></p><p>The Emergency Response element of the Civil Society program aims to train partner organisations to be better prepared to respond to emergency situations in their communities.

These distributions were funded by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The aid benefited 3,300 households and worked as the basis for other successful distributions on a much larger scale.
