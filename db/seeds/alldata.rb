The distributions in the district of Al-Kasrah- Dair Al Zor, consisted of 2,500 water filters, 2,500 hygiene kits, 2,500 winterisation kits, 200,000 aqua-tablets and 6,600 jerry cans. These distributions were funded by the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC). The aid benefited 3,300 households and worked as the basis for other successful distributions on a much larger scale. Now in 2016, WATAN has expanded its span of operation and is working on the rehabilitation of infrastructure of sewage systems in Mar’at al Numan, with ACTED, as well as a leishmaniosis line (between Ariha to Bennish) stretching more than 9 km, with OCHA. The WASH program is also working on the rehabilitation of water stations in more than 20 locations, such as Aleppo, Hasaka and Idleb, in partnership CARE, ACTED, World Vision and UNICEF.</p><p><strong>WATAN Program Philosophy and Differentiators</strong></p><p>WATAN’s WASH program has a Rapid Response network and when emergencies or displacement occurs, action is taken within 48-72 hours. There are three main steps that WATAN conducts:</p><ul><li>Rapid needs assessment.</li><li>Coordination with the partners.</li><li>Response.</li></ul><p>WATAN is also working to provide long-term projects with sustainable results, such as supply systems, sewage systems and solid waste management projects including rehabilitation of landfills. The aim is to create a hygienic environment in order to reduce risks of water-related diseases and further dire circumstances.</p><p>The WASH program has implemented many sustainable projects and are currently working on projects included sewage systems in Hasaka as well as supply systems in Daraa. WATAN’s strategy is about creating sustainability for long-term outcomes, with the aim of reaching more beneficiaries.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result of the Syrian crisis, many WASH facilities have been destroyed. &nbsp;WATAN has a deep understanding of the context, with sustainable and effective solutions applied by its specialised staff who have strong coordination with the local authorities and partners.</p><p>WATAN’s stability has allowed it to:</p><ul><li>Conducting sustainable projects on a large scale.</li><li>work with a strong relief network in order to respond rapidly reaching a large number of people in need in a short time, with support from partners and donors.</li><li>Works in hard to reach areas where no one else works.</li></ul><p><strong>WATAN projects</strong></p><ul><li>UNICEF WASH Project</li><li>ACTED WASH Project 1</li><li>ACTED WASH Project 2</li><li>ACTED WASH Project 3</li></ul><p><strong>Overall numbers and graphs:</strong></p><p>2012- 0</p><p>2013- 1000</p><p>2014- 200,000</p><p>2015- 841,066</p><p>2016- 1,513,138</p><p>Total number of beneficiaries- 2,555,204 beneficiaries</p><p><strong>Locations of intervention</strong></p><p>Syria:</p><p>Rural and city of Idleb, Hasaka, rural and city of Aleppo, Daraa and Qunaitra &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>", body2: nil, body3: nil, locations: nil}
